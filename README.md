# TreeWallets
A Hierarchial Wallet System with Central and Sub Wallets

## Context
- Revolving around central wallets and sub wallets
- Transferring all balances to a central wallet would not be possible unless you controlled the keys of every user wallet. 
- This would require an off-chain data store to manage key implementations
